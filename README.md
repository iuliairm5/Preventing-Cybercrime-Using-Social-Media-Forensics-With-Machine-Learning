A web application for personal social media forensics using a machine 
learning and data gathering server where users can track people by storing their suspect content 
(URLs, memes or images, texts or comments) with their predictions (good or bad) in an organized 
place. Moreover, each monitored user can be analyzed through a report containing the percentages 
of malicious content found, along with some profile public data regarding their personality and 
presence on the Internet. By doing this sum up as a report file, we can obtain an almost full portrait 
of the tracked user needed by the authorities when developing further investigations.
